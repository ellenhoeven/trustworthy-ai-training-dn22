    "\n",
    "Loans form an integral part of banking operations. However, not all the loans are promptly returned and hence it is important for a bank to closely monitor and understand loan applications so that they know which loans to reject and which to approve. \n",

    "This notebooks assess the fairness of machine learning models that use the German credit data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)). It contains details of 1000 loan applicants with 20 attributes and the classification whether an applicant is considered a \"good\" or a \"bad\" credit risk (target).\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how the AIF360 toolkit by IBM can used to detect and mitigate bias throughout different stages of machine learning. We assess the dataset and model on bias with respect to the age of loan applicants and go into various metrics to assess fairness and algorithms to mitigate bias.\n",
